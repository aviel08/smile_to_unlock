Smile to Unlock
===============

Smile to Unlock is a project that aims to provoke change on people's life by requesting them a positive gesture in order to function. In this case a smile is asked to the user to operate doors.

It is envisioned to be used at places where users come by pre-indispose, like public departments or a dentist's office.
Studies reveal that a smile is not only a result of positive feelings but also a catalyst for it.
