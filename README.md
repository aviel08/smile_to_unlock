Smile to Unlock
===============

Smile to Unlock is a project based on the work of [Dr. Robert Zajonc](http://zajonc.socialpsychology.org/), a psychologist at the University of Michigan. You can also read [A Feel-Good Theory](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/18/science/a-feel-good-theory-a-smile-affects-mood.html), an NY Times article about the subject. The main goal is to provoke change on people's life by asking them a positive gesture in order for an object to function. In this case a smile is asked to the user to operate doors. 

It is envisioned to be used at places where users come by pre-indispose, like public departments or a dentist's office.
Studies reveal that a smile is not only a result of positive feelings but also a catalyst for it. Evidence strongly shows that facial expression can influence mood.
